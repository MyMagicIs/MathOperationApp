# MathOperationApp

A simple C# Console Application that demonstrates:

- Creating a class and method
- Using parameters (including named parameters)
- Performing basic math operations
- Displaying output to the console

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

- The app defines a class called `MathClass`
- Inside the class, there's a method `PerformOperation(int firstNumber, int secondNumber)`
- The method multiplies the first number by 2 and displays both numbers
